		<h2> About me: </h2>
		
		<p>
			I am an aspiring software developer who finished his MMath from the university of Oxford in the year 2020.  In my spare time I like to make maps for the doom and hexen games and apply my knowledge of ACS and DECORATE to make modifications to the enemies and levels.  (If you want to see some of the maps I've made, take a look at the <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Zedonk">doom wiki.</a>)  I've also made a Unity game.
